# WELCOME TO OUR GITHUB !!
This will mostly be about Pony Town BUTTT!!! Check out the links we have for more info about us!! It's just our Carrd for now but have a DNI/INT Reentry and an Interest Reentry in the making!
## Basic info about us !!
ã…¤We are an OSDD1 system called The Garden of Meteor Showers!! We are open about being one and use Pony Town to help present ourselves!

ã…¤If you don't know who is fronting, you can call us either Icarus, Nyx or Meteor!        
ã…¤ã…¤(If you see a pony with quotes,ã…¤ã…¤ã…¤ã…¤[ex: "LET'S DANCE!" C+H/INT [SYS]] that is a cosplay! If you see an emoji at the front, [ex: ðŸª¦ || IcarusðŸ”ª IWC [SYS]] that is who is fronting!)

ã…¤We are a little slow at times due to multiple concussions and autism, please have some patience with us!

ã…¤Our main interests are Hermitcraft, Empires, the Life Series, and Murder Drones so you likely see us either on Hermit Hill or in the MD area!

## Just so you know!!
ã…¤We make kms jokes! Not often, but just keep that in mind! We won't ever make kys jokes to people outside of T.S.F, but we don't care if someone makes them at us!

ã…¤We say slurs we can reclaim (ex: F slur and T slur) Once again, this isn't often, but keep this in mind!

**PLEASEPLEASEPPPLEASEEEEE TELL US IF THIS MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE!!!!! We don't wanna do that to someone!!**

ã…¤If you see "DNIUSF." The s and f stand for "Silly freaks," the name of my main friend group! ***PLEASE RESPECT THIS.*** Even if you're on our friends list, there is a reason for this tag and you will be ignored.

ã…¤ Already mentioned this, but wanted to reiterate; We are slow. From a mix of health problems, meds, OSDD, and 7 concussions (yes, 7.), our processing time can take longer! Our memory as well can be super shitty, so we may not remember things right/at all. Please have patience with responses and we apologize in advance if we need you to re-word or remind us of something! Tone tags help sometimes, but overuse them, please. (ex: "Actually, could you go over there instead?/nf/nm/srs/neu/lh")

ã…¤We type quick, have shaky hands, AND are on mobile, typing will take a while, so sorry!

## Short DNI for PT!

**DNI IF YOU:**

ã…¤don't respect when someone has DNT/DNI in their name!

ã…¤make NSFW ponies and then proceed to go into the safe server!

ã…¤continue to try and role-play or interact with someone who is clearly ignoring you!
