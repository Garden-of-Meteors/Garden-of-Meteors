## â‹†.Ëšâœ® The Basics! âœ®Ëš.â‹†
ã…¤We are an 18yr old OSDD1 system called The Garden of Meteor Showers!! We are open about being one and use multiple different medias to help present ourselves!
<img width="1080" height="70" alt="Tumblr_l_720503787891657" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02f66cfc-4310-472c-84be-88464ba17af2" />
ã…¤If you don't know who is fronting, you can use Icarus or Meteor on us (or any of the other names listed on our [pronouns.cc](https://pronouns.cc/@GardenofMeteors)) But, please don't be afraid to ask who's fronting!! (It makes us very happy when people do......... (ã€€ï¼¾Ï‰ï¼¾))

ã…¤ã…¤**HOWEVER!** If you see a pony with an actual name (Examples; "DEXðŸ«¡ offtab, dniup [INTRJ]" or "TANGO-ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ kinda fuzzy [INTRJ]"), please use that name! That is whoever is fronting, and they put it there so they can be addressed with said name!

ã…¤Due to multiple circumstances (that we go over on our [strawpage](https://gardenofmeteors.straw.page/moreinfo)), we are unfortunately slow and might need clarification at times! Please have a bit of patience if we seem to be struggling and give us time to respond!

ã…¤ã…¤**DO NOT OVERUSE TONETAGS ON US!** We are not stupid, we just have struggles with our processing progress. One or two are fine, any more and we will say something.

ã…¤Our main interests are Hermitcraft, Empires SMP, Sweet Tooth, and The Life Series! (PLUS [MANY MORE!!](https://rentry.co/garden_of_meteors_interests))
