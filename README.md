# WELCOME TO OUR GITHUB !!
This will mostly be about Pony Town BUTTT!!! Check out the links we have for more info about us!! It's just our Carrd for now but have a DNI/INT Reentry and an Interest Reentry in the making!
## Basic info about us !!
ã…¤We are an OSDD1 system called The Garden of Meteor Showers!! We are open about being one and use Pony Town to help present ourselves!

ã…¤If you don't know who is fronting, you can call us either Icarus, Nyx or Meteor!        
ã…¤ã…¤(If you see a pony with quotes,ã…¤ã…¤ã…¤ã…¤[ex: "LET'S DANCE!" C+H/INT [SYS]] that is a cosplay! If you see an emoji at the front, ã…¤[ex: ðŸª¦ || IcarusðŸ”ª IWC [SYS]] that is who is fronting!)

ã…¤We are a little slow at times due to multiple concussions and autism, please have some patience with us!

ã…¤Our main interests are Hermitcraft, Empires, the Life Series, and Murder Drones so you likely see us either on Hermit Hill or in the MD area!

## Just so you know!!
ã…¤We make kms jokes! Not often, but just keep that in mind!

ã…¤We say slurs we can reclaim (ex: F slur and T slur) Once again, this isn't often, but keep this in mind!

**PLEASEPLEASEPPPLEASEEEEE TELL US IF THIS MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE!!!!! We don't wanna do that to someone!!**

ã…¤If you see "DNIUSF." The s and f stand for "Silly freaks," the name of my main friend group! ***PLEASE RESPECT THIS.*** Even if you're on our friends list, there is a reason for this tag and you will be ignored.
