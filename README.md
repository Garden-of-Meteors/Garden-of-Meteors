# WELCOME TO OUR GITHUB !!
This will mostly be about Pony Town BUTTT!!! Check out the links we have for more info about us!! We have a DNI/INT Reentry in the making, but have our interest Reentry posted!(VIEW IN DARK MODE, IT WAS MADE FOR THAT!!!!!) Our strawpage has a plushie guide and a basic guide for the frequent users of Ponytown! PLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASSSSSSSSSSSSSSEEEEEE go look at it and send us something while you're there!!
## Basic info about us !!
ã…¤We are a 17yr old OSDD1 system called The Garden of Meteor Showers!! We are open about being one and use Pony Town to help present ourselves!

ã…¤If you don't know who is fronting, you can call us either Icarus, Nyx or Meteor!        
ã…¤ã…¤(If you see a pony with quotes, [ex: "LET'S DANCE!" C+H/INT [SYS]] that is a cosplay! If you see an emoji at the front, [ex: ðŸª¦ || IcarusðŸ”ª IWC [SYS]] that is who is fronting!)

ã…¤We are a little slow at times due to multiple concussions and autism, please have some patience with us!

ã…¤Our main interests are Hermitcraft, Empires, and the Life Series so you likely see us either on Hermit Hill or following friends around!

## Just so you know!!
ã…¤We make kms jokes! Not often, but just keep that in mind! We won't ever make kys jokes at other people unless they're okay with it, but we don't care if someone makes them at us!

ã…¤We say slurs we can reclaim (ex: F slur and T slur) Once again, this isn't often, but keep this in mind!

**PLEASEPLEASEPPPLEASEEEEE TELL US IF THIS MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE!!!!! We don't wanna do that to someone!!**

ã…¤ Already mentioned this, but wanted to reiterate; We are slow. From a mix of health problems, meds, OSDD, and 7 concussions (yes, 7.), our processing time can take longer! Our memory as well can be super shitty, so we may not remember things right/at all. Please have patience with responses and we apologize in advance if we need you to re-word or remind us of something! Tone tags help sometimes, but don't overuse them, please. (ex: "Actually, could you go over there instead?/nf/nm/srs/neu/lh")

ã…¤We type quick, have shaky hands, AND are on mobile, typing will take a while, so sorry!

## Short DNI for PT!

**DNI IF YOU:**

ã…¤don't respect when someone has DNT/DNI in their name.

ã…¤make NSFW ponies and then proceed to go into the safe server.

ã…¤are one of those weird Joels on Hermit Hill. You know who you are, cause why did one of yall follow us around when we were trying to hang out with a friend in a Lizzie skin ?? Kinda weird ! Kindly fuck off unless we've already talked with you/know you AREN'T a weirdo. â™¡

ã…¤continue to try and role-play or interact with someone who is clearly ignoring you.

ã…¤use changelings skins. Sorry not sorry, but we've encountered far too many of you who just cannot respect simple boundaries. Please, find someone who wants to interact and don't start crying when someone tells you no. It's not cute, it's not funny, it's just strange behavior.

ã…¤actually use the r slur, especially directed at other people. We can kinda get it if you're calling yourself a (r word), but to others??? That's still ableist!

ã…¤seriously ship RPF. Get the fuck out?? GROSS. Even jokingly is on thin ice, that's still so... eugh....

## THIN ICE/IWC
