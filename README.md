## â‹†.Ëšâœ® The Basics! âœ®Ëš.â‹†
ã…¤We are an 18yr old OSDD1 system called The Garden of Meteor Showers!! We are open about being one and use multiple different medias to help present ourselves!

ã…¤If you don't know who is fronting, you can use Icarus or Meteor on us (or any of the other names listed on our [pronouns.cc](https://pronouns.cc/@GardenofMeteors))

ã…¤ã…¤**HOWEVER!** If you see a pony with an actual name (Examples; "DEXðŸ«¡ offtab, dniup [INTRJ]" or "TANGO-ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ kinda fuzzy [INTRJ]"), please use that name! That is whoever is fronting, and they put it there so they can be addressed with said name!

ã…¤Due to multiple circumstances (that we go over on our [strawpage](https://gardenofmeteors.straw.page/moreinfo)), we are unfortunately slow and might need clarification at times! Please have a bit of patience if we seem to be struggling and give us time to respond!

ã…¤Our main interests are Hermitcraft, Empires SMP, Sweet Tooth, and The Life Series! (PLUS [MANY MORE!!](https://rentry.co/garden_of_meteors_interests))

## Just so you know!!
ã…¤We make kms jokes! Not often, but just keep that in mind! We won't ever make kys jokes at other people unless they're okay with it, but we don't care if someone makes them at us!

ã…¤We say slurs we can reclaim (ex: F slur and T slur) Once again, this isn't often, but keep this in mind!

**PLEASEPLEASEPPPLEASEEEEE TELL US IF THIS MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE!!!!! We don't wanna do that to someone!!**

ã…¤ Already mentioned this, but wanted to reiterate; We are slow. From a mix of health problems, meds, OSDD, and 7 concussions (yes, 7.), our processing time can take longer! Our memory as well can be super shitty, so we may not remember things right/at all. Please have patience with responses and we apologize in advance if we need you to re-word or remind us of something! Tone tags help sometimes, but don't overuse them, please. (ex: "Actually, could you go over there instead?/nf/nm/srs/neu/lh")

ã…¤We type quick, have shaky hands, AND are on mobile, typing will take a while, so sorry!

## Short DNI for PT!

ã…¤don't respect when someone has DNT/DNI in their name.

ã…¤make NSFW ponies and then proceed to go into the safe server.

ã…¤are one of those weird Joels on Hermit Hill. You know who you are, cause why did one of yall follow us around when we were trying to hang out with a friend in a Lizzie skin ?? Kinda weird ! Kindly fuck off unless we've already talked with you/know you AREN'T a weirdo. â™¡

ã…¤continue to try and role-play or interact with someone who is clearly ignoring you.

ã…¤use changelings skins. Sorry not sorry, but we've encountered far too many of you who just cannot respect simple boundaries. Please, find someone who wants to interact and don't start crying when someone tells you no. It's not cute, it's not funny, it's just strange behavior.

ã…¤copy ponies w/o permission. Get creative!

ã…¤actually use the r slur, especially directed at other people. We can kinda get it if you're calling yourself a (r word), but to others??? That's still ableist!

ã…¤seriously ship RPF. Get the fuck out?? GROSS. Even jokingly is on thin ice, that's still so... eugh....
