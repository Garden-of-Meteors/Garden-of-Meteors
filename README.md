# WELCOME TO OUR GITHUB !!
This will mostly be about Pony Town BUTTT!!! Check out the links we have for more info about us!! We don't know when a DNI/INT reentry will be made, but we have our interest reentry posted!(VIEW IN DARK MODE, IT WAS MADE FOR THAT!!!!!) Our strawpage is still a wip but pleasee go check it out!!! It has a pony guide, lot of information about us, and it just looks pretty!!
## Basic info about us !!
ㅤWe are a 17yr old OSDD1 system called The Garden of Meteor Showers!! We are open about being one and use multiple things to help present ourselves! (Pony Town, Pronouns.cc, Strawpages, etc..)

ㅤIf you don't know who is fronting, you can call us either Icarus, Meteor, or Lizzie!        
ㅤㅤ(If you see an emoji at the front, [ex: 🪦 || Icarus🔪 IWC [SYS]] that is an alter skin! **PLEASE USE THE NAME ON THE PONY THEN!** It can be genuinely a little distressing at times if someone wears their skin only to be called another headmates name.)

ㅤWe are a little slow at times due to multiple concussions and autism, please have some patience with us!

ㅤOur main interests are Hermitcraft, Empires, and the Life Series so you likely see us either on Hermit Hill or following friends around!

## Just so you know!!
ㅤWe make kms jokes! Not often, but just keep that in mind! We won't ever make kys jokes at other people unless they're okay with it, but we don't care if someone makes them at us!

ㅤWe say slurs we can reclaim (ex: F slur and T slur) Once again, this isn't often, but keep this in mind!

**PLEASEPLEASEPPPLEASEEEEE TELL US IF THIS MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE!!!!! We don't wanna do that to someone!!**

ㅤ Already mentioned this, but wanted to reiterate; We are slow. From a mix of health problems, meds, OSDD, and 7 concussions (yes, 7.), our processing time can take longer! Our memory as well can be super shitty, so we may not remember things right/at all. Please have patience with responses and we apologize in advance if we need you to re-word or remind us of something! Tone tags help sometimes, but don't overuse them, please. (ex: "Actually, could you go over there instead?/nf/nm/srs/neu/lh")

ㅤWe type quick, have shaky hands, AND are on mobile, typing will take a while, so sorry!

## Short DNI for PT!

**DNI IF YOU:**

ㅤdon't respect when someone has DNT/DNI in their name.

ㅤmake NSFW ponies and then proceed to go into the safe server.

ㅤare one of those weird Joels on Hermit Hill. You know who you are, cause why did one of yall follow us around when we were trying to hang out with a friend in a Lizzie skin ?? Kinda weird ! Kindly fuck off unless we've already talked with you/know you AREN'T a weirdo. ♡

ㅤcontinue to try and role-play or interact with someone who is clearly ignoring you.

ㅤuse changelings skins. Sorry not sorry, but we've encountered far too many of you who just cannot respect simple boundaries. Please, find someone who wants to interact and don't start crying when someone tells you no. It's not cute, it's not funny, it's just strange behavior.

ㅤcopy ponies w/o permission. Get creative!

ㅤare apart of "W.S.S"(Wilbur support squad.) HE IS AN ABUSER. ***FUCK. OFF IF YOU STILL THINK SHELBY IS LYING.***

ㅤare a Dream supporters and/or are a support of his weirdass group (Sapnap and George), especially George supporters. Yall chased a wonderful woman off the internet. ***FUCK OFF.***

ㅤare an Iskall supporter, honestly. Haven't seen you outside of youtube comments, but we don't want to. ***FUCK OFF.***

ㅤactually use the r slur, especially directed at other people. We can kinda get it if you're calling yourself a (r word), but to others??? That's still ableist!

ㅤseriously ship RPF. Get the fuck out?? GROSS. Even jokingly is on thin ice, that's still so... eugh....

## THIN ICE/IWC

ㅤDSMP side of the hill. We've met a few of yall that are nice, but yall still make us iffy.
